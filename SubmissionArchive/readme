Description
The features were as follows:
Hippocampus:
	We manually defined a region of the brain that contained most of the hippocampus in most images.
	This area was then analysed for mean, variance and median values. The area was then also separated into 3x3x3
	smaller areas and histograms taken of each individual area.
Amygdala:
	Was also manually defined a region of the brain that contained most of the amygdala in most images.
	Then processed the area in the same way as the hippocampus.
GrayWhiteMatterRatio:
	We split the brain into 8x8x8 areas and counted the number of gray voxels and white voxels in each area, then returned
	a vector containing these 512 ratio values.
SymmetryScore:
	Brain was again split into 8x8x8 areas and each area was compared to its counterpart in the opposite hemisphere. Each area then
	received a score denoting the similarity to it's mirrored equivalent.
BlackMatter:
	The centre of the brain was split into 3x3x3 areas and then the number of black or "very dark" voxels was counted since we noticed a
	significant difference in the size of this area between f.x. healthy and unhealthy brains.
GrayMatter:
	The brain was split into 8x8x8 areas and the number of gray (defined as intensities between 450 and 800) voxels counted in each area.
Age:
	We noticed a significant correlation between age and health. Our age predictor proved quite accurate so we decided to use the age label as
	a feature for determining health.

After feature extraction, features were hand picked for each label depending on cross validation scores and plotted images for data visualization.
For each label, all the features associated with it were then concatenated into one big feature vector.

For each label we created a specialized classifier and trained on the respective data.
Using cross validation we attempted to manually fine tune the hyperparameters, feature and classifier selection.

Finally when creating the predictions, we first predicted gender and age, and then appended the predicted age label to the health test data to
predict the health label.
