Description
	We have taken two features from the data and for each kind of feature, trained a model that is
	a combination of several models.

	For our final submission, we gave these models weights based on their log loss score and performed
	a weighted average of the predictions.

Preprocessing
	PCA to reduce dimensions, standard scaling, split brains to sections 8x8x8 to keep structural information

Features
	Our features were gray areas of the brain, similarity between right and left brain, and previously histograms
	of the brain but we removed those because they reduced the quality of the model.
	
Model
	For each of the features, that is flip and gray areas, we used the following models,
		* Random Forest Classifier 
		* SVM linear classifier 
		* Gaussian Process classifier
		* Neural net

	For each feature, we fitted each of these models and then we combined them using Voting Classifier.

Postprocessing
	Predictions from both voting classifier models were combined
	using a weighted average as previously stated.
